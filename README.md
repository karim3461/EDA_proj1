# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Project 1

For this first project, we need to reproduce the four plots in the **figure** folder. 

To reproduce each of the plots, download the R scripts to a directory in your machine and make sure that the raw data 
file **household_power_consumption.txt** is in the same directory.

Edit each R script file and replace my working directory "G:/R/Workspace/ExploratoryDataAnalysis" with yours.
Then run each R script separatly to generate the appropriate plot (for example, to reproduce plot1.png, run the R script plot1.R). 

Note that these scripts have been successfully tested on a PC running Windows 7 and R version 3.1.2.
