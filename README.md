# Exploratory Data Analysis : Project 1

For this first project, we need to reproduce the four plots in the **figure** folder. 

To reproduce each of the plots, download the R scripts to a directory in your machine and make sure that the raw data 
file household_power_consumption.txt ins in the same directory.
Then run the appropriate R script to generate each plot (for example, to reproduce plot1.png, run the R script plot1.R).
